    "- Silk: A natural protein fiber produced by silkworms and spiders, known for its mechanical strength, flexibility, and biodegradability. In scientific applications, silk refers to silk fibroin, a protein-based biomaterial.\n",
    "- Biocompatibility: The ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response when applied in a medical context. It means the material does not provoke an immune response and integrates well with biological tissues.\n",
    "- Biological Materials: Substances that are produced by or interact with living organisms. This includes both natural and engineered materials used in biomedical applications, such as proteins, cells, and biopolymers.\n",
    "- Multifunctionality: The capacity of a material or system to perform multiple functions simultaneously. In biomaterials, this includes properties like mechanical strength, biodegradability, antimicrobial activity, and environmental responsiveness.\n",
    "- Self-cleaning: A property of materials that enables them to repel or degrade contaminants without external assistance. Often linked with hydrophobic surfaces or photocatalytic activity.\n",
    "- Broad Applicability in Biomaterial Design: The versatility of a material, such as silk, to be used across a range of applications, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, and sensors due to its adaptable properties.\n",
    "- Biopolymers: Naturally occurring polymers produced by living organisms. These include polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Biopolymers are typically biodegradable and biocompatible.\n",
