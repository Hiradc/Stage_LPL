      "  \"hypothesis\": \"We hypothesize that by genetically engineering silkworms to produce silk fibroin incorporating a periodically patterned tyrosine-rich sequence inspired by beetle cuticle nanostructures, we can create biocompatible, self-cleaning silk biomaterials exhibiting tunable structural coloration, thereby reducing the overall energy expenditure required to produce colored biomaterials compared to traditional pigment-based methods.\",\n",
      "  \"outcome\": \"The genetically engineered silkworms will produce silk fibroin with a defined tyrosine-rich sequence, (Tyr-X-Tyr-Y)n, where X and Y are short, optimized sequences (e.g., Ala-Gly and Ser-Ala, respectively) mimicking the amino acid composition found at the interfaces of cuticle layers in *Chrysochroa fulgidissima* beetles. Silk fibers spun from this modified fibroin will exhibit structural coloration, with the reflected wavelength (λ) tunable via control of the repeat unit number (n) and the refractive index difference (Δn) between the tyrosine-rich and native fibroin domains, following Bragg's law: λ = 2d⋅n⋅cos(θ), where d is the periodicity of the layers (controlled by sequence length), n is the average refractive index, and θ is the angle of incidence. We anticipate achieving vibrant colors spanning the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) with Δn between 0.1 and 0.2, tunable with 'n' ranging from 5 to 20 repeats. The energy expenditure, measured in joules per gram of colored silk produced, will be at least 30% lower than that required to produce an equivalent amount of silk dyed with traditional organic pigments, measured using bomb calorimetry and accounting for silkworm metabolic activity.\",\n",
      "  \"mechanisms\": \"The genetic engineering will involve inserting a gene cassette encoding the (Tyr-X-Tyr-Y)n repeat sequence into the silkworm genome, specifically targeting the fibroin heavy chain locus. The expressed modified fibroin will self-assemble into β-sheet structures, driven by the hydrophobic interactions of tyrosine residues. The periodic arrangement of tyrosine-rich domains and native fibroin domains will create alternating layers with different refractive indices. Light incident on these layers will undergo constructive and destructive interference, resulting in structural coloration. The tyrosine-rich surfaces are expected to exhibit self-cleaning properties due to a combination of increased surface roughness (promoting a Cassie-Baxter wetting state) and the intrinsic hydrophobicity of tyrosine. The overall hydrophobicity will measured by contact angle goniometry, expecting contact angles with water exceeding 120 degrees. Self-cleaning efficacy will be tested using standard soiling tests with nanoparticles (e.g., TiO2) and measuring the reduction in surface contamination after exposure to simulated rainfall.\",\n",
      "  \"design_principles\": \"1. **Amino Acid Sequence Design for Structural Color:** Implement the (Tyr-X-Tyr-Y)n repeat motif in the silk fibroin sequence, where X and Y are optimized to control the packing of the beta-sheets. The spacing and choice of amino acids in the X and Y sequences will need to be fine-tuned based on molecular dynamics simulations to achieve the desired refractive index contrast and layer periodicity. The Tyr percentage should be maximized for optimal refractive index. We'll target roughly 30-40%. 2. **Genetic Engineering of Silkworms:** Use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to insert the modified fibroin gene cassette into the silkworm genome, ensuring stable expression and integration into the existing fibroin production machinery. The insert will be flanked by homology arms homologous to the target fibroin gene region. 3. **Optimization of Layer Periodicity:** Adjust the number of repeats ('n') in the (Tyr-X-Tyr-Y)n sequence to precisely control the layer thickness and thus the reflected wavelength, allowing for tunable structural coloration across the visible spectrum. Target thickness ranging from 50 nm to 150 nm. 4. **Surface Topography for Self-Cleaning:** Leverage the increased surface roughness induced by the tyrosine-rich domains to enhance the self-cleaning properties of the silk. Nanoscale features such as nanoscale ripples will be incorporated into the design to promote superhydrophobicity. 5. **Biocompatibility Optimization:** Ensure the modified fibroin retains its inherent biocompatibility by minimizing any unintended immune responses. The final construct should demonstrate comparable cell viability and inflammatory response profiles as native silk fibroin in *in vitro* assays. 6. **Energy Efficiency Optimization:** Optimize silkworm rearing conditions (temperature, humidity, diet) to minimize energy expenditure during silk production. We will carefully control the silkworms' diet to provide optimum ratios of carbohydrates, fats and protein. 7. **Multifunctionality Integration**: incorporate stimuli-responsive amino acids (e.g. azobenzene-modified amino acids) at specific locations within the (Tyr-X-Tyr-Y)n sequence to enable dynamic control over the structural color in response to external cues (e.g. light or pH).\",\n",
      "  \"unexpected_properties\": \"We anticipate the genetically modified silk may exhibit enhanced mechanical strength compared to native silk due to the increased hydrogen bonding network formed by the tyrosine residues. This is because the increase in aromatic rings will allow for increased pi-pi stacking. Additionally, the ordered arrangement of the tyrosine-rich domains might lead to piezoelectric properties, generating a small electrical charge upon mechanical deformation. This behavior is plausible if the engineered asymmetry of the crystal structure introduces a net dipole moment. We expect the electrical output to be on the order of picowatts per gram, detectable using sensitive current amplifiers. Finally, the enhanced UV absorption of the tyrosine-rich domains could result in improved UV protection compared to native silk, potentially making it suitable for UV-protective clothing or wound dressings. We predict the UV protection factor (UPF) to increase by at least 20%, measured using a spectrophotometer.\",\n",
      "  \"comparison\": \"Traditional methods of coloring silk rely on dyeing with organic pigments, which often involve energy-intensive chemical synthesis and can pose environmental concerns due to dye waste and potential toxicity. Compared to silk dyed with synthetic pigments, the structurally colored silk will eliminate the need for these harmful chemicals, reducing environmental impact. Furthermore, pigment-based coloration is prone to fading over time, while structural coloration is inherently more stable. Quantum dot-based structural coloration techniques often suffer from cytotoxicity issues and require complex fabrication processes. The proposed genetically engineered silk offers a more sustainable and biocompatible alternative. Compared to other biopolymers like collagen or hyaluronic acid, silk fibroin offers superior mechanical strength and processability, making it a more suitable candidate for structural coloration applications.\",\n",
      "  \"novelty\": \"The novelty lies in the integration of structural coloration principles inspired by insect cuticle nanostructures into a biocompatible, self-cleaning silk biomaterial through genetic engineering of silkworms. This approach offers a sustainable and energy-efficient route to producing colored biomaterials, eliminating the need for harmful dyes. Existing methods of generating structural colors in biomaterials often involve complex and expensive fabrication processes, while our approach leverages the natural silk production machinery of silkworms. The incorporation of self-cleaning functionality further enhances the versatility and longevity of the biomaterial, expanding its potential applications in biomedical devices, textiles, and optical sensors. This research pushes the boundaries of biomaterial design by combining bioinspiration, genetic engineering, and materials science to create a truly multifunctional and sustainable material.\"\n",
