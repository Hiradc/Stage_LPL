    "- Biocompatibility: The ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response when applied in a medical context. It means the material does not provoke an immune response and integrates well with biological tissues.\n",
    "- Biological Materials: Substances that are produced by or interact with living organisms. This includes both natural and engineered materials used in biomedical applications, such as proteins, cells, and biopolymers.\n",
    "- Multifunctionality: The capacity of a material or system to perform multiple functions simultaneously. In biomaterials, this includes properties like mechanical strength, biodegradability, antimicrobial activity, and environmental responsiveness.\n",
    "- Self-cleaning: A property of materials that enables them to repel or degrade contaminants without external assistance. Often linked with hydrophobic surfaces or photocatalytic activity.\n",
    "- Broad Applicability in Biomaterial Design: The versatility of a material, such as silk, to be used across a range of applications, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, and sensors due to its adaptable properties.\n",
    "- Biopolymers: Naturally occurring polymers produced by living organisms. These include polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Biopolymers are typically biodegradable and biocompatible.\n",
    "- Fibroin: The structural protein that forms the core of silk fibers, known for its crystalline β-sheet structure, which provides strength and stability to silk materials.\n",
    "- Structural Coloration: A color-producing mechanism caused by micro- or nanostructures that interfere with light rather than by pigments. Found in butterfly wings and beetle shells.\n",
    "- Insects: A class of arthropods characterized by three-part bodies, exoskeletons, and six legs. Many exhibit structural coloration due to microscopic surface structures.\n",
